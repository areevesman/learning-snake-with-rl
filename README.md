# Reinforcement Learning for Snake

The code in this repository is used to train agents to play snake using techniques from reinforcement learning.
Tabular Q-learning and Value Function Approximation are implemented (using a simple Neural Network).

## Setup

- Clone the repository: `https://github.com/areevesman/reinforcement-learning-for-snake.git`
- To play snake:
   - `cd code`
   - `python snake.py`
- To train a snake with Q-learning:
   - `cd code`
   - `python train_q_learning.py`
- To train a snake with VFA:
   - `python train_deep_q_learning.py`
- Training output will be saved to a `results` folder in the working directory
