# Learning Snake with Reinforcement Learning

## Contributors

## Research question

Can we use Q-learning to train an agent to play Snake? Can we improve upon the results with Value Function Approximation (VFA) and deep learning?

## Progress

The python script [code/snake.py](code/snake.py) contains the implementation.
- environment (see the `Game` class)
- agent (see the `Snake` class)
  - can take random actions or be controlled by human (see `App` class)

## Todo in order to finish
- add code for reinforcement learning (Q-learning/VFA)
