# Reinforcement Learning for Snake

The code in this repository is used to train agents to play snake using techniques from reinforcement learning.
Tabular Q-learning and Value Function Approximation are implemented (using a simple Neural Network).

## Resources

- A human playable version of snake is implemented in [code/01_human_snake.py](code/01_human_snake.py)
   - to play, run `python 01_human_snake.py` from the command line
- Q-learning is implemented in [code/02_q_learning_snake.py](code/train_q_learning.py)
- Value Function approximation is implemented in [code/03_deep_q_learning_snake.py](code/train_deep_q_learning.py)
